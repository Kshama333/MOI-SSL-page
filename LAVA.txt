  <h1><strong>Introduction</strong></h1>
  <p>Hey Guys! Today we will learn about SSL/TLS vulnerability detection and with that I will also teach you how to automate responses using a quite handy-dandy python tool called <b>CAPIC</b>! If you are interested in network security vulnerability management or just want to learn this in your free time, then you found the right place! Let's get into it!</p>

  <h1>What is SSL/TLS</h1>
  <p>SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) and TLS (Transport Layer Security) are encryption protocols used to <u>ensure secure</u> communication over computer networks.</p>

  <h4>Key Functions</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Ensures data confidentiality</li>
    <li>Authentication: Verifies the identity</li>
    <li>Integrity: Ensures data is not tampered with during transit.</li>
  </ul>

  <h1>Common SSL/TLS Handshake issues</h1>
  <table border="1" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0">
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Weak Cipher Suites</th>
        <th>POODLE (CVE-2014-3566)</th>
        <th>Protocol Downgrades</th>
      </tr>    
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>Some cipher suites (e.g. RC4, 3DES) are considered insecure</td>
        <td>Attacks SSLv3 protocol through padding oracle</td>
        <td>Attackers may force a connection to use insecure SSL/TLS versions (e.g., SSLv3 or TLS 1.0)</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

  <h1><u>Solution</u></h1>
  <ol>
    <li>SSL/TLS Layer Inspection: Monitor for unexpected cipher suites in <b>ClientHello</b> and <b>ServerHello.</b></li>
    <li>Analyze Handshake Failures: Detect excessive handshake failures by monitoring alert levels from TLS alert messages.</li>
    <li>Packet Sniffing: Use python Scapy library for packet sniffing for detailed anomaly detection.</li>
    <li>Automated Response Workflow: Real time alerting and automated response by isolating affected systems, blocking malicious traffic, and initiating emergency protocols to secure critical assets.</li>
  </ol>
  <hr>

  <h1>SSL/TLS Vulnerability Detection Workflow</h1>
  <ol>
    <li>Network Traffic Analysis: Attacker crafts a weapon (exploit) to take advantage of the flow.</li>
    <li>Vulnerability Scanning: The exploit is executed, allowing unauthorized access or execution of malicious actions.</li>
    <li>Trigger automated response: By isolating the affected machine or service, blocking malicious traffic through firewall rules, initiating emergency protocols (e.g., notify admins, log incident).</li>
  </ol>

  <h1>Sample: Use Scikit Learn for Anomaly Detection</h1>
  <p><b>Step 1: Data Collection</b> Gather system logs, network traffic, or other data sources to represent normal behaviour.</p>

  <p><b>Step 2: Train A Model:</b> Use machine learning and train an Isolation Forest model to detect anomalous behaviour. Isolation Forest is a popular unsupervised learning algorithm for anomaly detection. It detects anomalies by isolating observations that are different from the majority.</p>

  <h1>Security Protocols for Threat mitigation</h1>
  <h4>Use <b>Strong</b> Cipher Suites</h4>
  <p>Disable weak ciphers like RC4, DES, and MD5.</p>

  <h4>Patch Management</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Ensure all systems are updated with the latest SSL/TLS patches.</li>
    <li>Use TLS 1.2 or 1.3.</li>
    <li>Disable SSLv2, SSLv3, and weak ciphers.</li>
    <li>Implement forward secrecy.</li>
    <li>Automate regular vulnerability scans to detect outdated SSL/TLS configurations.</li>
  </ul>
